            <p>Second, the application and actual laying down of the concrete. This can be crucial for the overall look of your
                concrete. You donâ€™t want just a lump of concrete as a concrete pad, because people would rather walk on the dirt
                around it instead of your nice concrete! To prevent such a problem, we can look at certain tools that will be very
                handy for your laying down. One tool is called a mag. A mag is (its simplified for magnetic) a tool that will
                attract stuff in the concrete and makes the finish smoother than what concrete workers usually use.</p>

        <p>What concrete
            workers usually use is a wooden board to make sure that the concrete is flat and will look good from all angles. A
            useful way to use your wooden plank as well is not only to make it flat, but you can also use it to make sure there
            are no bubbles in the concrete. The bubbles can make the concrete very weak. The bubbles in the concrete are often
            known as honeycombing. Honeycombing can be solved by using your wooden board by slightly pressing down on your wet
            concrete and releasing the pressure repeatedly. This will help the bubbles slowly rise to the surface and get rid
            of the honeycombing that no one wants. Something that you must have on you when messing with wet concrete is
            gloves.</p>

            <p>Gloves can protect your hands and fingers from any chemical burns that you can get from concrete. Something
                else that you will likely need is a place to mix your concrete in and something to take your concrete out and throw
                it where you want it to be. Then after this, you need to have the right finish that you want on your concrete. An
                easy way to finish your concrete properly is to have a broom and glide the broom softly across the surface of the
                concrete. You may not want the concrete to be bumpy from the broom, yet it is a necessity to have it be done
                because if you do not, it will be easy to slip and fall without that grip that the broom gives you.</p>
