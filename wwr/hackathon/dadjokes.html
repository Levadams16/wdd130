        <p><strong>tabletennispro:</strong> I remember when I walked to school in these conditions. It was snowing half the school year most of the time. It was such a steep climb that I felt like I was climbing Mt. Everest every day. These kids nowadays have the luxury of going to school in the wife's van and they still complain. I can't believe them.</p>

            <p><strong>construdad:</strong> I adopted a dog from a blacksmith. As soon as I brought him home, he made a bolt for the door.</p>
            <p><strong>muhammed1984:</strong> Why did the coach put the frog on the outfield? Because it was really good at catching flies.</p>
